                        <a class="navbar-brand text-light fs-7">In addition to the basic configuration of a station, various features set certain station<br> types apart. The first is the level of the tracks. Stations are often sited where a <br>road crosses the railway: unless the crossing is a level crossing, the road and railway <br>will be at different levels. The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to <br>the station entrance: the station buildings may be on either level, or both. The <br>other arrangement, where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level, is <br>also common, but is perhaps rarer in urban areas, except when the station is a <br>terminus. Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the <br>roadway while it stops, causing road traffic to wait for an extended period of time. <br>Stations also exist where the station buildings are above the tracks. <br>An example of this is Arbroath.<br><br></a>

A loop line without a <br>platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only, it is<br> called passing track.

Trains arriving <br>there have to end their journeys (terminate) or reverse out of the station. Depending on <br>the layout of the station, this usually permits travellers to reach all the platforms <br>without the need to cross any tracks the public entrance to the station and the main<br> reception facilities being at the far end of the platforms.<br><br></a>
                        <a class="navbar-brand text-light fs-7">Some termini have a newer set of through platforms underneath (or above, or alongside) <br>the terminal platforms on the main level. They are used by a cross-city extension of the <br>main line, often for commuter trains, while the terminal platforms may serve <br>long-distance services. Examples of underground through lines include the Thameslink <br>platforms at St Pancras in London, the Argyle and North Clyde lines of Glasgow's suburban <br>rail network, in Antwerp in Belgium, the RER at the Gare du Nord in Paris, the Milan <br>suburban railway service's Passante railway, and many of the numerous S-Bahn lines <br>at terminal stations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, such as at ZÃ¼rich Hauptbahnhof. <br>Due to the disadvantages of terminus stations there have been multiple cases...<br><br></a>
