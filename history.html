            <a class="navbar-brand text-light fs-7">The first stations had little in the way of buildings or amenities. The first stations in<br> the modern sense were on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, opened in <br>1830. Manchester's Liverpool Road Station, the second oldest terminal station <br>in the world, is preserved as part of the Museum of Science and Industry <br>in Manchester. It resembles a row of Georgian houses.<br><br></a>
            <a class="navbar-brand text-light fs-7">Early stations were sometimes built with both passenger and freight facilities, though<br> some railway lines were goods-only or passenger-only, and if a line was dual-purpose<br> there would often be a freight depot apart from the passenger station.<br> This type of dual-purpose station can sometimes still be found today, though in<br> many cases goods facilities are restricted to major stations.<br><br></a>

The station was slightly older than the still extant <br>Liverpool Road railway station terminal in Manchester. The station was the first to <br>incorporate a train shed. Crown Street station was demolished in 1836, as the<br> Liverpool terminal station moved to Lime Street railway station. Crown Street <br>station was converted to a goods station terminal.<br><br></a>

            <a class="navbar-brand text-light fs-7">Many stations date from the 19th century and reflect the grandiose architecture of<br> the time, lending prestige to the city as well as to railway operations. Countries <br>where railways arrived later may still have such architecture, as later stations <br>often imitated 19th-century styles. Various forms of architecture have been used in <br>the construction of stations, from those boasting grand, intricate, Baroque- or <br>Gothic-style edifices, to plainer utilitarian or modernist styles. Stations in Europe tended <br>to follow British designs and were in some countries, like Italy, financed by British <br>railway companies.<br><br></a>
            <a class="navbar-brand text-light fs-7">Train stations built more recently often have a similar feel to airports, with a simple,<br> abstract style. Examples of modern stations include those on newer high-speed rail<br> networks, such as the Shinkansen in Japan, THSR in Taiwan, TGV lines in France,<br> and ICE lines in Germany.<br><br></a>
